## All challenges come from Edabit.com

```

### This project will be split into three sections

```
The green section will be challenges I was able to complete.
The yellow section will be code I used to solve the challenge.
Finally, the red section will be for those challenges that even after using other resources, I wasn't at the time able to solve.
```

### This file is just to track my progress through challenges

```
This isn't meant to show myself completeling the hardest and craziet challenges, but to get my mind going in the morning and practice whiteboard-type questions
